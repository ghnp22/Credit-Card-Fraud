### Description:
The need to develop accurate and efficient fraud detection models has become crucial due to the rising cases of credit card fraud. This project aims to address this issue by leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques to improve fraud detection in the financial sector.

***Research methodology***
Python is the primary programming language, with machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Scikit-learn being utilized to implement models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Isolation Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, Deep Neural Networks, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).

***Output:***
- Random Forest and CatBoost were the most effective models, achieving near-perfect accuracy (99.99% and 99.95%).
- LSTM demonstrated high accuracy but required significant computational resources, while Isolation Forest performed poorly.
=> The conclusion recommends using Random Forest and CatBoost for credit card fraud detection, with potential improvements for the LSTM model in the future.
